## Data-set can be found in the following link:
https://laboratorio-ia.epn.edu.ec/es/recursos/dataset/2020_emg_dataset_612

## Data convertion from .json to .mat 
* Download the Training users dataset and paste it into the folder "trainingJSON".

* Download the Testing users dataset and paste it into the folder "testingJSON".

> Run jsontomat.m

* After executing jsontomat.m two folders will be generated:
   * TrainingData folder
   * TestingData folder

## Instructions for Matlab:
> Run Main.m

> Select the experiment to run
### Parameters:
* Syncro: number of synchronization signals to test (1-4).

### MENU:

* Gesture Recognition
  * [1] Experiment 1       This option runs the experiment 1
  * [2] Experiment 2       This option runs the experiment 2
  * [3] Experiment 3       This option runs the experiment 3
  * [4] Experiment 4       This option runs the experiment 4
  * [5] Exit
 
#### Select an option to run: 

* Classification Models
  * [1] General            This option runs the general model in the current experiment 
  * [2] Especific          This option runs the specific model in the current experiment 
  * [3] Exit
